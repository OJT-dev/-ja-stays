# Current Task: Property Matching Algorithm Implementation

## Objective
Implement Einstein-inspired property matching algorithm and integrate with property listing page.

## Related Roadmap Items
- Implement Einstein-inspired property matching algorithm (from projectRoadmap.md)

## Completed Work
1. Created matching.ts in src/services/ai/
2. Implemented PropertyMatcher class with match scoring algorithm
3. Added unit tests in tests/unit/matching.test.ts
4. Updated codebaseSummary.md to include new matching service
5. Integrated matching algorithm with PropertyListingPage.tsx
6. Updated Property interface to match backend model
7. Created propertyService.ts for API integration

## Next Steps
1. Update project roadmap to mark this feature as completed
2. Add user preferences form to PropertyListingPage
